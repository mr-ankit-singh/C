#__ Storage Classess __#

   + C Storage classes provide the following information to the compiler
       - Storage area of a variable.
       - Scope of variable i.e. in which block the variable is visible.
       - The lifetime of a variable i.e. how long the variable will be there in active mode.
       - The default value of a variable if it is not initialized.

   - Thus a storage class is used to represent the information about a variable.

   NOTE: A variable is not only associated with a data type, its value but also a storage class.

   + There are total four types of standard storage classes. 

       Storage class	Purpose
       auto	            It is a default storage class.
       extern	        It is a global variable.
       static	        It is a local variable which is capable of returning a value even when control is transferred to the function call.
       register	        It is a variable which is stored inside a Register.
