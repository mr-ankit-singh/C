#__ Register Storage Class __#

   - It is a special kind of variable that stores in the CPU register.
   - The advantages of register variables are faster than the remaining variables.
   - The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. 
   - This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size
